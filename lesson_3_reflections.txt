When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with other person on the same project, or to share with the community your projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because other developers might introduce changing not compatible with what are you working with locally

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch is a branch of one single repository, which can be locally or on GitHub server.
    It is done to develop idea without changing the working version of the code, the master version
    clone is a copy of a local or remote repository to a local repository
    fork is a clone of a remote repository to a remote repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allow you to pull using fetch + merge in order to not overwrite what you are doing locally

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    sending the code version. the coding part would be faster, but the interaction between version would be painfull

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when I work with others and when the changes are expected to be important or time-consuming
