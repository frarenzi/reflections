Francesca's Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections

1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug that was introduced?

It was helpful because the bug was only in one of the versions, and diff select only the modified rows

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You might decide that your modifications do not improve your code, so you might start from a old version

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros: you can create commit that are at the logical point of the coding
(in one hour you migh do three commits, the next hour just one)
cons: doing manually requires commitment and when creating the commit depends on the developer

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git was created with coding in mind, when you develop a coding project often more 
files are linked together.

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

'git log' gives the overview of the all commits created, their ID and description. 
with 'git diff' you can compare two commit to see how many rows are deleted or created
and which modifications are performed

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you can easy checkout the previous version and understand when the mistakes have been maden.


7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For my projects, to get used to git before the London school
