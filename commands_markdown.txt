To make text bold, surround it with double asterisks:
	Isn't today a **wonderful** day?

To italicize text, surround it with underscores:
	And in that moment I thought to myself: _Did I turn off the stove?_

Inline code, you'll surround text in backticks (`, not a single quote):
	You should use the `strong` tag.

Headings:For h1 through h6 tags, desc in importnace, # before your text.
The number of #s you include tells Markdown which header tag you're using. For example:
	## This is an h2.
	### This is an h3.
